This is the repository containing my Emacs Configuration File.

I try to follow the paradigm of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate Programing]] in order to make my Emacs configuration as much as possible self-explanatory.

The configuration start [[file:config.org][here]].
